# To-Do-List_LocalStorage

I designed a TO-DO list to learn more about Javascript 

 To-Do list takes users name and store it in the local storage

Then the user can select Add to do, the task will be added to the to do list, and then user can press edit button to change the task or user can also press delete button to remove the task
