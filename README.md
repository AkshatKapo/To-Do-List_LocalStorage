# To-Do-List_LocalStorage

I designed a TO-DO list to learn more about Javascript, it works as a same To-Do list i designed before, but now I change designing because I wanted to learn more about designing and the data that user put does not disappear when page is reloaded.

 To-Do list takes users name and store it in the local storage

Then user can add the tasks, like Play games

Then the user can select Add to do, the task will be added to the to do list, and then user can press edit button to change the task or user can also press delete button to remove the task

When user is done the task, to know that task is done. The user can select the checkbox or click deletet button to remove it.

The data that user put is stored in the local storage, so that when user reloads the page, the data that user entered before still remain on the screen.

The data in the local storage is stored as objects.
